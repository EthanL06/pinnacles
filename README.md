A collection of peak resources for web developers and designers. We aim to provide a curated list of resources that are useful, high-quality, and up-to-date. 

I created this site to solve the frustration of finding great resources but struggling to keep track of them. Over the years, I‚Äôve collected hundreds and wanted a simple way to organize and share them.
